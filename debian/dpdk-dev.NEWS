dpdk (18.11-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  As a result from switching the build system to Meson, the following changes
  happened since 17.11:
  - Switch PMD installation directory from /usr/lib/*/dpdk-18.11-drivers to
    /usr/lib/*/dpdk/pmds-18.11.
  - Remove backward-compatibility symlink for arch-dependent headers. Users
    now should use the libdpdk.pc pkg-config file to get the appropriate
    CFLAGS, or specify -I/usr/include/<ARCH>/dpdk manually.
  - Drop the dpdk-dev SDK package, users should just use pkg-config now.
  - Rename all binaries and scripts to have a dpdk- prefix.
