    Remove backward-compatibility symlink for arch-dependent headers. Users
    now should use the libdpdk.pc pkg-config file to get the appropriate
    CFLAGS, or specify -I/usr/include/<ARCH>/dpdk manually.
    Drop the dpdk-dev SDK package, users should just use pkg-config now.
    Rename all binaries and scripts to have a dpdk- prefix.
    Build-Depend on debhelper >= 10.3~, which introduced Meson support.
  * Don't build dpdk-doc when using the nodoc profile.

  * Override lintian warning about scripts with extension in bin.
  * Add libssl-dev dependency on libdpdk-dev for libcrypto.pc.
  * Add libbsd-dev dependency on libdpdk-dev for bsd/string.h.
  * Drop fix-vhost-user-socket-permission.patch and
    tmpfix-ppc-build-error.patch. The latter has been fixed upstream,
    and the former is not needed as we no longer support vhost-user
    in client mode. Please switch to server mode.
  * Add new DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS dpdk_config_options that accepts a comma
    separated list (no spaces) of additional DPDK build configure options that
    will be passed to Meson. Substitutes support for custom legacy Makefile
    config files.

    - adapt to use MAJOR_ABI configuration to avoid the sub-lib abi
      version breakage of the past.

      provided "test" tool in /usr/share/dpdk/test/ of dpdk-dev.
      Note: testpmd is installed "officially" by install-sdk and therefore
      stays separate from other test tools.
    - updated library arch availability/dependency: librte-kni is
      available on ppc64el; librte-pmd-i40e on all arches;

  * Team upload.

  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * Fix d/p/fix-vhost-user-socket-permission.patch for dpdk 16.07
    server/client sockets.
  * d/control add python-elftools and hwdata dependencies to dpdk for the tool
    dpdk-pmdinfo.
  * d/rules utilize RTE_EAL_PMD_PATH to autoload pmd drivers
    - d/dpdk-doc.README.Debian document usage of RTE_EAL_PMD_PATH
    - d/control let the runtime of dpdk recommend the pmd drivers to make them
      available for auto-probing devices.
  * d/rules support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS parallel
  * d/rules bundle autotest as it is ready after build into dpdk-dev
    to make it available for autopkgtest and likewise developers.
  * enable dpdk autotests
    - d/t/test-autotest enable autotests as dep8 test. These fail in many
      build environments, so put them in an adt where required characteristics
      can be specified

  [ Gowrishankar Muthukrishnan ]
  * d/p/dpdk-dev-examples-ip_pipeline-fix-pmd-driver-parameter.patch to make
    ip_pipeline work properly with -d eal parameter
  * Update to d/p/dpdk-dev-examples-ip_pipeline-fix-pmd-driver-parameter.patch
    fixing dl_open issues.

  [ Santiago R.R. ]
  * debian/rules: Only export hardening related building HOST_/EXTRA flags
    when dpkg-dev < 1.18.11. On newer dpkg-dev versions, dpkg-buildflags
    handle them directly and are injected by gcc (6.x). Closes: #843685.

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * Fix DKMS build to use the requested kernel version rather than the running
    one. (Closes: #843864)
  * Fix kernel modules build failures due to the new -fPIE default by passing
    -fno-PIE.
  * Backport dpdk-dev-kni-fix-build-with-kernel-4.9.patch to fix kernel modules
    build failures on Linux 4.9.
  * Mark dpdk-doc as Multi-Arch: foreign

    spelling-error-in-readme-debian to to (duplicate word) to"
  * Fix upstream rc versions by using "~" instead of "-". 16.07-rc1 evaluates
    as newer than 16.07 which causes issues with Debian tools and Lintian
    errors and warnings:

    ksrc=<path/to/kernel/sources> to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS) into a
    dpdk-modules-<kernel version> package
  * Set HOST_/EXTRA/CPP/C/LDFLAGS in d/rules so that all built objects pick up
    all flags set by the dpkg environment, like hardening flags
  * Add rte-compile-pre-cppflags.patch to make all DPDK objects pick up the
    user specified or environment specified CPP/C/LDFLAGS.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Guard dep8 tests against non supported platforms (LP: #1551158):
    - d/t/control now avoids failing due to "dependencies are unsatisfiable"
      when fetching packages. The packages architecture restrictions got added
      to avoid that.
    - d/t/check-dpdk-supported-arch.sh is called by all DPDK tests to ensure
      the platform is supported. If not it skips the test.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * fix libdpdk.so library linking (LP: #1547517)
    - libdpdk.so now has proper linkage information (was underlinked)
      Note: this can be dropped when moving to DPDK 2.3 with linker script
            instead of combined shared lib.
    - remove reference to extra linkage needed when building against -ldpdk
      in dpdk-doc README.
    - add dep8 d/t/test-linkage to verify linking dpdk works as expected.
  * d/control remove ${shlibs:Depends} on package with no linked binary
    avoiding dpkg-gencontrol build warning about unknown ${shlibs:Depends}.
  * d/dpdk-doc.README.debian fix path to DPDK build environment variable
    helper script in README file.
  * Update VCS Info in d/control to include our repositories.

  [  James Page ]
  * d/*: wrap-and-sort.
  * d/control: Trim trailing whitespace.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Merge from Upstream to DPDK 2.2
    Remaining changes:
    - Set soabi for the combined shared library
  * Drop changes:
    - configuring RTE_LIBNAME to dpdk as it is the upstream default now
    - enabled formerly non building components as they build properly in 2.2
    - d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
      Replace use of DejaVuSansMono is no more needed as upstream changed the
      font. Thereby we can drop our delta.
    - d/p/ubuntu-fix-gcc5-ftbs.patch no more needed with DPDK 2.2
  * Added changes
    - Disable CONFIG_RTE_NEXT_ABI as required for packaging (git 506f51cc)
    - Enable LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP which is useful for some DPDK testcase examples
      this adds a build dependency to libpcap-dev
    - Fully support DH_VERBOSE for build debugging convenience
    - adapt to new make infrastructure of dpdk 2.2
    - d/README.debian: convert into d/dpdk-doc.README.debian
    - d/dpdk-doc.README.debian: update recommendations about sdk env variables
    - d/dpdk-sdk-env.sh: now deployed in /usr/share/dpdk to be opt in
    - enable XEN support for dpdk (LP: #1521289).

dpdk (2.0.0-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Only generate HTML documentation, easing backports to 14.04 and
    reducing the time to build and size of the -doc package (LP: #1524700).

dpdk (2.0.0-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=low

  * d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
    Replace use of DejaVuSansMono by courier and drop dependency on the
    texlive-fonts-extra package (which is in universe).
  * d/watch added to allow use of uscan to check for upstream releases.
  * d/dpdk-init: fix error if bash variables could not be resolved that
    appeared as "[: -gt: unexpected operator" (had no functional impact)
  * d/dpdk-init:
    Replace use of head and cut (in /usr/bin) commands with sed (in /bin)
    while also adding /usr/bin to the PATH used on direct /etc/init.d/dpdk
    invocation. The PATH is only updated to be on the safe side, there
    should be no other commands from /usr/bin used (LP: #1516543).
  * d/t/test-mountpoint: add dep8 test to cover the issue of LP #1517075.
  * d/dpdk-dev.install: Copy the SDK makefiles into place (LP: #1517075).
