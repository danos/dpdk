dpdk (18.11-rc3-1~git1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * New upstream release 18.11; for a full list of changes see:
    https://dpdk.org/doc/guides/rel_notes/release_18_11.html
  * Add new 18.11 PMDs and libraries:
    - librte-common-cpt18.11
    - librte-common-dpaax18.11
    - librte-pmd-atlantic18.11
    - librte-pmd-caam-jr18.11
    - librte-pmd-octeontx-crypto18.11
    - librte-telemetry18.11
  * Bump debhelper compat to 10.
  * Switch to Meson. Rename PMD packages to follow the shared library names:
    - librte-pmd-vmxnet3-uio18.11 -> librte-pmd-vmxnet3-18.11
    - librte-pmd-lio18.11 -> librte-pmd-liquidio18.11
    - librte-pmd-octeontx-ssovf18.11 -> librte-pmd-octeontx-event18.11
    - librte-pmd-octeontx-zip18.11 -> librte-pmd-octeontx-compress18.11
    - librte-pmd-sfc-efx18.11 -> librte-pmd-sfc18.11
    - librte-pmd-thunderx-nicvf18.11 -> librte-pmd-thunderx18.11
    Switch PMD installation directory from /usr/lib/*/dpdk-18.11-drivers to
    /usr/lib/*/dpdk/pmds-18.11.
    Remove backward-compatibility symlink for arch-dependent headers. Users
    now should use the libdpdk.pc pkg-config file to get the appropriate
    CFLAGS, or specify -I/usr/include/<ARCH>/dpdk manually.
    Drop the dpdk-dev SDK package, users should just use pkg-config now.
    Rename all binaries and scripts to have a dpdk- prefix.
    Build-Depend on debhelper >= 10.3~, which introduced Meson support.
  * Don't build dpdk-doc when using the nodoc profile.
  * Build-depend on libjansson-dev, libbsd-dev and libelf-dev.
  * Package libraries built by default:
    - librte-pmd-bnx2x18.11
    - librte-pmd-ccp18.11
    - librte-pmd-dsw-event18.11
  * Use dh-missing.
  * Package zlib PMD:
    - librte-pmd-zlib18.11

  * Enable PIE hardening.
  * Override lintian warning about scripts with extension in bin.
  * Add libssl-dev dependency on libdpdk-dev for libcrypto.pc.
  * Add libbsd-dev dependency on libdpdk-dev for bsd/string.h.
  * Drop fix-vhost-user-socket-permission.patch and
    tmpfix-ppc-build-error.patch. The latter has been fixed upstream,
    and the former is not needed as we no longer support vhost-user
    in client mode. Please switch to server mode.
  * d/p/0003-build-set-mfpu-neon-flag-for-armv7a-builds.patch: fix armhf build
  * Add new DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS dpdk_config_options that accepts a comma
    separated list (no spaces) of additional DPDK build configure options that
    will be passed to Meson. Substitutes support for custom legacy Makefile
    config files.

  * Build-Depend on debhelper (>= 9.20160709) | dh-systemd to keep
    compatibility with Ubuntu 16.04, which does not yet have that
    of debhelper.
  * Revert: d/rules: use new dh option names - Ubuntu 16.04 does not
    have a debhelper that supports the new option, so use the old
    ones for now.
  * Drop librte-pmd-xenvirt17.11, deprecated upstream, and related
    build-dependencies.
  * Correctly parse upstream version when using ~rc instead of -rc.
  * Update symbols files for 17.11.
  * Backport testpmd-link-virtio.patch to link testpmd with the virtio
    pmd to fix failure to run in VMs with virtio based interfaces
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.1.1, no changes.

  * d/control: add librte-pmd-octeontx17.11
  * d/t/control: fix test dependencies for s390x (Closes: #882480).
  * d/rules: make auto-loaded drivers dir versioned (LP: #1741244).
    3rd party drivers should drop into the versioned directories now to show
    their support for that version and to be autoloaded by librte_eal due
    to that.

  * debian/rules: use dpkg's DEBIAN_VERSION_UPSTREAM and DEB_HOST_*
    variables instead of parsing and setting them manually.
  * Update symbols files to reflect changes in the libraries.
  * Switch to debian.org email address.
  * Add librte-pmd-failsafe package.
  * Drop mk-order-CFLAGS-so-that-ISCDIR-comes-before-IRTE_OUT.patch and

    result but is much simpler and easier to maintain.
  * Build-Depend on debhelper (>= 9.20160709) rather than dh-systemd as
    latter is deprecated. Fixes Lintian Error:
      build-depends-on-obsolete-package
  * Build-Depend on the Python 3 version of the Sphinx packages to fix

  * New Upstream release 17.05; For a full list of changes (LP: #1691661)
    see http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/rel_notes/release_17_05.html
    - adapt to use MAJOR_ABI configuration to avoid the sub-lib abi
      version breakage of the past.
    - add d/update-helper* to update d/control and d/*.symbols for new versions
    - adapt to new build trigger and location of tests; provide further
      test tools (testacl, testpipeline) together with the already
      provided "test" tool in /usr/share/dpdk/test/ of dpdk-dev.
      Note: testpmd is installed "officially" by install-sdk and therefore
      stays separate from other test tools.
    - updated library arch availability/dependency: librte-kni is
      available on ppc64el; librte-pmd-i40e on all arches;
      librte-pmd-fm10k gone on ppc64el
    - package the 19 new sub-libs / pmds that are now built by default
    - rename and update symbols files to match the update to DPDK 17.05

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * Rename libraries after ABI major version rather than source version.
  * Always set CONFIG_RTE_MAJOR_ABI, even for custom config files as all the
    packaging is tuned around it.
  * Drop patches merged upstream and refresh
    fix-vhost-user-socket-permission.patch
  * Add patches to make the documentation and linker script builds fully
    reproducible.
  * Add patches to make the libraries and PMDs builds fully reproducible,
    by making the listing order of headers, source files and objects in
    the makefiles stable (via sorting).
  * Install headers with arch-specific content in /usr/include/<multiarch>/dpdk
    to make libdpdk-dev multiarch-compliant.
    To ensure backward compatibility in x86_64, which is what most of the
    consumers use, symlink x86_64 headers in /usr/include/dpdk.
    pkg-config returns the arch-specific headers first so that other
    architectures are still compatible.
    Also create a full copy of the headers in the dpdk-dev SDK package, as it
    does not support multiple levels of headers.

    let users choose to enable it by passing dbgsym_meta via DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    Thanks Jan Blunck for the patch!
  * Generate dependency list of libdpdk-dev to all librte and PMDs packages
    dynamically at build time.
  * Generate list of recommends for dpdk dynamically at build time.
  * dpdk-modules-$KVERS: depend on same kernel version used to build rather than
    just recommend - in-kernel API/ABI is not stable.
  * Support for building packages for the new mempool framework has been added.
    In 17.05 and newer a mempool framework was added, that has to be loaded
    like a PMD. So any "plugin" will be linked in RTE_EAL_PMD_PATH just like
    the PMDs. No mempool plugins are built for now, so it is currently a no-op.
  * Drop libethdev4, librte-cryptodev1 and librte-eal2 transitional packages,
    no longer needed.
  * Fix some upstream documentation links in the packages metadata.

  * Fix typo in dpdk-doc.README.Debian, fixes "W: dpdk-doc:
    spelling-error-in-readme-debian to to (duplicate word) to"
  * Fix upstream rc versions by using "~" instead of "-". 16.07-rc1 evaluates
    as newer than 16.07 which causes issues with Debian tools and Lintian

    ksrc=<path/to/kernel/sources> to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS) into a
    dpdk-modules-<kernel version> package
  * Set HOST_/EXTRA/CPP/C/LDFLAGS in d/rules so that all built objects pick up
    all flags set by the dpkg environment, like hardening flags
  * Add rte-compile-pre-cppflags.patch to make all DPDK objects pick up the
    user specified or environment specified CPP/C/LDFLAGS.

    - to fix that without breaking the API and potential workaround code in
      consumers of the library like openvswitch 2.6 for example. This patch
      adds an EAL commandline option to specify user:group created vhost_user

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu5) xenial; urgency=medium

  * d/t/test-initscripts fix issues regarding 1G hugepages
     - the dep8 was already taking care of 1G hugepages being not supported in
       some environments. But it was failing when supported, but not enough
       memory available.

  * d/rules replaced uname -m with DEB_HOST_GNU_CPU (LP: #1551796):
  * fix testpmd to run without Xen environment (LP: #1551752):
     - upstream discussion is slow, but we need a fix now. We can drop this
       and change to the upstream solution when it is available.
  * avoid errors due to missing modules (LP: #1554397):
     - d/dpdk-init gracefully warns about missing modules.
     - d/control now suggests linux-image-generic.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Guard dep8 tests against non supported platforms (LP: #1551158):
    - d/t/control now avoids failing due to "dependencies are unsatisfiable"
      when fetching packages. The packages architecture restrictions got added
      to avoid that.
    - d/t/check-dpdk-supported-arch.sh is called by all DPDK tests to ensure
      the platform is supported. If not it skips the test.

dpdk (2.2.0-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Christian Ehrhardt ]
  * fix libdpdk.so library linking (LP: #1547517)
    - libdpdk.so now has proper linkage information (was underlinked)
      Note: this can be dropped when moving to DPDK 2.3 with linker script
            instead of combined shared lib.
    - remove reference to extra linkage needed when building against -ldpdk
      in dpdk-doc README.
    - add dep8 d/t/test-linkage to verify linking dpdk works as expected.
  * d/control remove ${shlibs:Depends} on package with no linked binary
    avoiding dpkg-gencontrol build warning about unknown ${shlibs:Depends}.
  * d/dpdk-doc.README.debian fix path to DPDK build environment variable
    helper script in README file.
  * Update VCS Info in d/control to include our repositories.

  [  James Page ]

  * Merge from Upstream to DPDK 2.2
    Remaining changes:
    - Set soabi for the combined shared library
  * Drop changes:
    - configuring RTE_LIBNAME to dpdk as it is the upstream default now
    - enabled formerly non building components as they build properly in 2.2
    - d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
      Replace use of DejaVuSansMono is no more needed as upstream changed the
      font. Thereby we can drop our delta.
    - d/p/ubuntu-fix-gcc5-ftbs.patch no more needed with DPDK 2.2
  * Added changes
    - Disable CONFIG_RTE_NEXT_ABI as required for packaging (git 506f51cc)
    - Enable LIBRTE_PMD_PCAP which is useful for some DPDK testcase examples
      this adds a build dependency to libpcap-dev
    - Fully support DH_VERBOSE for build debugging convenience
    - adapt to new make infrastructure of dpdk 2.2
    - d/README.debian: convert into d/dpdk-doc.README.debian

  * d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
    Replace use of DejaVuSansMono by courier and drop dependency on the
    texlive-fonts-extra package (which is in universe).
  * d/watch added to allow use of uscan to check for upstream releases.
  * d/dpdk-init: fix error if bash variables could not be resolved that
    appeared as "[: -gt: unexpected operator" (had no functional impact)
  * d/dpdk-init:
    Replace use of head and cut (in /usr/bin) commands with sed (in /bin)
    while also adding /usr/bin to the PATH used on direct /etc/init.d/dpdk
    invocation. The PATH is only updated to be on the safe side, there
    should be no other commands from /usr/bin used (LP: #1516543).
  * d/t/test-mountpoint: add dep8 test to cover the issue of LP #1517075.
  * d/dpdk-dev.install: Copy the SDK makefiles into place (LP: #1517075).
